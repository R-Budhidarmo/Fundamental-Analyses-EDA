## Exploratory Data Analysis on Fundamental Data

In [healthcare_stocks_EDA_Apr2023.ipynb](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Fundamental-EDA/blob/main/healthcare_stocks_EDA_Apr2023.ipynb), an EDA was performed on a dataset of selected mega cap healthcare stocks (> $ 200 billion by market capitalisation) obtained using [FinViz stock screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx).
The data have been retrieved using [FinViz stock screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx) on 24 April 2023 from FinViz's 'Overview', 'Valuation' and 'Financial' tabs. The only parameters selected was:
- Market Cap. = Mega ($200bln and more).
- Sector = Healthcare

The data were then copied and pasted manually into Excel. Like on FinViz website, the data are organised into three tabs in the xlsx file (overview, valuation & financial).
