## Exploratory Data Analysis on Mega Cap Healthcare Stocks

An EDA was performed on a dataset of selected mega cap healthcare stocks (> $ 200 billion by market capitalisation) obtained using [FinViz stock screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx).
The data have been retrieved using [FinViz stock screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx) on 24 April 2023 from FinViz's 'Overview', 'Valuation' and 'Financial' tabs. The only parameters selected was:
- Market Cap. = Mega ($200bln and more).
- Sector = Healthcare

The data were then copied and pasted manually into Excel (since I haven't quite gotten the hang of using the various FinViz APIs. The xlsx file is included in this repo). Like on FinViz website, the data are organised into three tabs in the xlsx file (overview, valuation & financial).
