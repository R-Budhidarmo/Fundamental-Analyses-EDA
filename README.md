## Exploratory Data Analysis on Fundamental Data of Stocks

In [healthcare_stocks_EDA_Apr2023.ipynb](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Fundamental-EDA/blob/main/healthcare_stocks_EDA_Apr2023.ipynb), an EDA was performed on a dataset of selected mega cap healthcare stocks (> $ 200 billion by market capitalisation) obtained from [FinViz stock screener](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx).
The data have been retrieved in April 2023 from FinViz screener's 'Overview', 'Valuation' and 'Financial' tabs.

In [fundamental_data_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Fundamental-EDA/blob/main/fundamental_data_analysis.ipynb), fundamental data for selected biotech stocks have been scraped from Yahoo Finance in Sep 2023. The code for web-scraping can be found in [fundamental_data_scraper.py](https://github.com/R-Budhidarmo/Fundamental-EDA/blob/main/fundamental_data_scraper.py). The ticker symbols can be customised if needed.
